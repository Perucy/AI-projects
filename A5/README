Purpose: README for naive_bayesian.py


Files: naive_bayesian.py
Purpose: The file contains a program that implements a recursive naive bayesian algorithm to classify tracks recorded
        by a radar as either a bird or an airplane
        The program first reads test, bird and plane track data from dataset.txt and testing.txt and adds them to a
        numpy array. The NaN values are replaced by the mean of the non-NaN values in a row.
        The bird and plane tracks arrays are used to obtain the variance values for which the bird track is
        expected to have a high value compared to a plane since birds have a widely varying velocity compared to
        planes that travel in a constant velocity.
        The test track variance is also obtained and used together with the mean and standard deviation values of bird
        and plane track variances to determine the new likelihoods of birds and planes to be used as an additional
        feature for classification
        The new likelihoods are multiplied by the given likelihoods from likelihood.txt and for the bird and plane
        likelihoods the maximum value is obtained and returned as the likelihood values

        Track classification uses a recursive bayesian algorithm that applies the bayes formula. The posterior
        probabilities of bird and plane are initially determined from the given prior probabilities and later
        updated using the transitional probabilities and previous posterior probabilities.
        The evidence value is determined from the likelihood and posterior probability values.
        The classification depends on the higher value between the posterior probability of a bird and that of a plane
        for which 'b' is added to a list and 'a' otherwise.
        The final classification values are returned where 'b' represents a bird and 'a' an airplane

Assumptions:
    - Variance is the new classification feature
    - Variance values of birds is higher than that of airplanes
    - Birds have a varying velocity while planes have a constant velocity
    - Transition probabilities are 0.9 for bird to bird and plane to plane
    - Prior probability values are 0.5 for bird and planes which is continuously updated
    - The NaN values are replaced by the mean of the non-NaN values in a track.

Bugs:
    - My program has bugs that cause the final classification to match 9/10 values to the expected classification
